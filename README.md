DMAssassins
===========

[Assassins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)) is Live Action Game where players are assigned a target to "kill" by shooting them with Silly Stringâ„¢. The game runs in a giant loop (picture a circular linked list), and players continue to "kill" their targets until only one player is left.

DMAssassins is a webapp designed to manage large scale games of assassins where palyers may or may not know each other. They are given a reasonable amount of information about their target to help track them down.

This repo is my third version of assassins and was written with the goal of learning both Golang and BackboneJs. A fully fledged version is running at [dmassassins.com](http://dmassassins.com)

If you'd like to see the first two implementations of assassins you can check out [DMAssassins-1.0](https://github.com/mattgerstman/DMAssassins-1.0) and [DMAssassins-2.0](https://github.com/mattgerstman/DMAssassins-2.0).
