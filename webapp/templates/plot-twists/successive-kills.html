The following will happen if you implement this plot twist:<br />
<ol>
    <li>All users will have a new target</li>
    <li>If a player makes a kill and has already killed in the last 24 hours they will get two points.</li>
    <li>A player will get no more than 2 points per kill.</li>
    <li>If a player is on a kill spree, they can potentially rack up a series of 2 point kills.</li>
    <li>Users will be emailed informing them of the plot twist</li>
</ol>
