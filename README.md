DMAssassins
===========

[Assassins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)) is Live Action Game where players are assigned a target to "kill" by shooting them with Silly Stringâ„¢. The game runs in a giant loop (picture a circular linked list), and players continue to "kill" their targets until only one player is left.

DMAssassins is a webapp designed to manage large scale games of assassins where players may or may not know each other. They are given a reasonable amount of information about their target to help track them down. Admins can create and manage any number of games so that friends or organizations can play together regularly. It also features automated "plot twists" which cleverly rearrange targets and give the players new constraints to keep the game interesting.

This repo is my third version of assassins and was written with the goal of learning both Golang and BackboneJs. It was written to be a fully RESTful Single Page Application. I learned a lot while doing this project and it's still in active development.

Games will be available for sale at [dmassassins.com](http://dmassassins.com) in mid 2015. This code is intended as a public sample of my work and can not be resold. You can feel free however, to use it to host your own games. DMAssassins always has and always will be free to play for any Dance Marathon organizations.

If you'd like to see the first two implementations of assassins you can check out [DMAssassins-1.0](https://github.com/mattgerstman/DMAssassins-1.0) and [DMAssassins-2.0](https://github.com/mattgerstman/DMAssassins-2.0).
