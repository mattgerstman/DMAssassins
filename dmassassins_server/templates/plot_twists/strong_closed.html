<p>Hey %recipient.first_name%,</p>

<p>Bob Dylan once wrote The Times They Are a-Changin' and once again, change is in the air. We like to reward players for their hard work. If the strongest (most kills) player for their team has died they've been revived. Just to keep things even however all the strongest players are targeting each other. For everyone else, you get a new target.</p>

<p>One more thing: Anyone who doesn't kill their new target by {{.Deadline}} is out.</p>
<p>Log in <a href="http://playassassins.com">here</a> to check out your new target!</p>

<p>Good Luck!<br />
The Assassins Team</p>
